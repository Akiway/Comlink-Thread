# Comlink-Thread
FoundryVTT module adding a comlink system for Shadowrun.

Credit for concept and design, forked from the initial project of the same name by TonkatsuRa: https://tonkatsura.github.io/Comlink-Thread/comlink.html.
Initial idea was to simply port his code into FoundryVTT, but I decided to go further and add features.
